<!-- INTRO-START -->

NMOS is a family name for specifications produced by the Advanced Media Workflow Association related to networked media for professional applications.

For a non-technical introduction to NMOS see AMWA's [overview page](https://www.amwa.tv/nmos-overview).

The tables below list the current specifications and provide links to their documentation on [specs.amwa.tv](https://specs.amwa.tv). The "Release" links will take you to the documentation and download page (â†“) for the latest release of recent versions of the specification.

> The tables no longer include direct links to the GitHub repos. These are available through the [NMOS CI Dashboard](https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos/Dashboard.html).

The [NMOS API Testing Tool](https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos-testing) supports the majority of these specifications.

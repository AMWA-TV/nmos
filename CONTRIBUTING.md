Thanks for your interest in this AMWA NMOS Specification.

AMWA Specifications (including Best Current Practices) are developed and ratified in accordance with 
AMWA's Specification Process. See BCP-001 on the [AMWA Specifications page](https://www.amwa.tv/specifications)

They are created and updated in AMWA working groups, requiring AMWA membership for participation.

AMWA member contributions to this Specification are made subject to AMWA's [IPR Policy](https://www.amwa.tv/about/policies/AMWA_IPR_Policy_V3.0.pdf). 
Contributions should be accompanied by the form in an appendix of that policy.

For more information for those wishing to develop or contribute to AMWA NMOS Specifications,
please see the NMOS [Wiki Page](https://github.com/amwa-tv/nmos/wiki/Maintainers) for maintainers.

## Reporting Issues

AMWA members and non-members are welcome to raise issues via the GitHub Issues tab.

## Pull Requests

We accept Pull Requests from AMWA members participating in relevant workgroups. These are subject to the IPR Policy.

Please read about our [GitHub Workflow](https://github.com/amwa-tv/nmos/wiki/GitHub-Workflow) before creating a pull request, 
in particular the 'Maintaining a Specification' section, as we try to maintain a consistent approach to branches and releases.
This should indicate which branch it is most appropriate to create your pull request against.

Each NMOS workgroup has a number of members that will review a PR.
